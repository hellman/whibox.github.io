	  <p>The challenge of white-box cryptography (WBC) is to develop implementation techniques for cryptographic programs to protect their inner keys against an all-powerful adversary that knows the program and can play with it at will. This area of cryptography has long been overlooked and perceived as “impossible to realize” in spite of a strong industrial demand for reliable construction techniques. With the rise of iO on one hand, the emergence of powerful attack techniques such as DCA on the other, and the accelerated deployment of WBC-based applications on smartphones, the field of WBC is currently at a critical point and has never attracted more attention within the crypto community (academia, industry and government agencies). The Wh<span class="orange">i</span>b<span class="orange">O</span>x <a href="/contests.html">competitions</a> has shown that this tremendous interest was largely shared within the community, and could also translate into operational work in building or attacking white-box implementations. </p>
