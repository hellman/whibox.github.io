#+TITLE: README


* Setup development environment
** Install Ruby and Jekyll
See [[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/][jekyll installation documentation]].
Please don't forget to add *Ruby*, *bundle*, and *jekyll* in your =PATH=.
** Install gems
#+begin_src bash
bundle install
#+end_src
* Local server
You can serve the website locally by using
#+begin_src bash
jekyll serve
#+end_src
This is very useful for development because the local server will monitor the modification of source code and it will regenerate the site on-the-fly if any modification is made.
